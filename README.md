This is a (very) simple app  to learn how to use angular from scratch (including the bower and package stuff).

What does it do?
=

It's a single page with a input text field and a load button. Type in a Youtube URL (or a video id) and it will show
on the right side of the page!

How do I run it?
=

* Git clone the project
* Have Node.js and npm `apt-get install nodejs-legacy npm`
* Install whatever Node.js need `npm install`
* Maybe install bower`sudo npm install -g bower`
* Run a local web-server `npm start`
* Connect to localhost:8000/app/index.html

It doesn't work!
=
OK, then let me know :)
